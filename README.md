### To run the project make sure you install the dependencies and use npm run dev.

It is a simple Portfolio Web-Page, the information provided on the page may or may not be accurate.

As Requested it will not use any back-end or database.

## Features

The site features different menus to navigate the user through the site to show the Portfolio user's LinkedIn, past projects, current projects, etc.

CSS should apply to both mobile and desktop users and scale accordingly.

It will use React from NextJS instead of plain HTML+CSS+JS/TS.

It will utilize JavaScript over TypeScript due to it being an individual project.

Under the services page there will be an option to request "services". Currently it does not lead to any sort of database but it does provide confirmation if the form has been filled correctly.
